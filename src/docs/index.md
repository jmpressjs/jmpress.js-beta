# Getting started

The only required files are [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [jmpress.js](#builder) to use.

For a quick and simple example look at the [examples/simple/index.html](https://github.com/shama/jmpress.js/blob/beta/examples/simple/index.html) and [examples/simple/simple.css](https://github.com/shama/jmpress.js/blob/beta/examples/simple/simple.css).

## Migrating from impress.js

Currently jmpress.js includes all of the impress.js features and a lot more.

To migrate simply add jQuery, change impress.js to jmpress.js and call `$(selector).jmpress();` to initialize. Take a look at the [impress.js running on jmpress.js](http://shama.github.com/jmpress.js/examples/impress/) example.
