<h1>Callbacks</h1>

<p>Callbacks are a way to trigger a specific action when an event is fired
within jmpress.js. For instance if we want to fire some code before a slide
change we use the beforeChange callback:</p>
<pre><code>$('#jmpress').jmpress({
	'beforeChange': function( element, eventData ) {
		// ...
	}
});</code></pre>
<p>All callbacks supply the same two parameters: element, the element the event
	pertains to and eventData, various data associated with the event.</p>
