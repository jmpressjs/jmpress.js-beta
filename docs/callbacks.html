<h1>Callbacks</h1>

<p>Callbacks are a way to trigger a specific action when an event is fired
within jmpress.js. For instance if we want to fire some code before a slide
change we use the beforeChange callback:</p>
<pre><code>$('#jmpress').jmpress({
	'beforeChange': function( element, eventData ) {
		// ...
	}
});</code></pre>
<p>All callbacks supply the same two parameters: element, the element the event
	pertains to and eventData, various data associated with the event.</p>

<h2>Available Callbacks</h2>
<ul>
	<li><em>setActive</em>: When a step is activated or selected.
	<li><em>setInactive</em>: When a previously active step is de-activated or
		not
	<li><em>afterInit</em>: After all the steps are initialized.
	<li><em>afterDeinit</em>: After all the steps are de-initialized.
	<li><em>beforeChange</em>: Before each step change. <em>eventData.cancel()</em>
		cancels the select.
	<li><em>beforeDeinit</em>: Before all the steps are de-initialized.
	<li><em>beforeInit</em>: Before all the steps are initialized.
	<li><em>beforeInitStep</em>: On each step as it is initialized.
	<li><em>initStep</em>: On each step as it is initialized.
	<li><em>applyStep</em>: Called last on each step after it is initialized.
	<li><em>unapplyStep</em>: Called last on each step after is is de-initialized.
	<li><em>idle</em>: When on step while transition finishs.
	<li><em>ajax:loadStep</em>: When a step has began loading via AJAX.
	<li><em>ajax:afterStepLoaded</em>: Called after the AJAX step has finished loading.
	<li><em>selectEnd</em>: Callback should return the last step.
	<li><em>selectHome</em>: Callback should return the first step.
	<li><em>selectInitialStep</em>: Callback should return the initial step.
	<li><em>selectNext</em>: Callback should return the next step.
	<li><em>selectPrev</em>: Callback should return the prev step.
		selected.
</ul>

<p>Additionally the jQuery events <em>enterStep</em> and <em>leaveStep</em> will
be fired on the step element. These events can be added to specific steps to be 
triggered as the step is entered and left:</p>
<pre><code>$('#a-specific-step')
	.on('enterStep', function(event) {
		// Called when entering only this step
	})
	.on('leaveStep', function(event) {
		// Called when leaving only this step
	});</code></pre>
