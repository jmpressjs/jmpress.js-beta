		<h2>Edit &amp; Build</h2>
		<p>All the source files are located in the <em>src/</em> folder. They
		are broken up into components and plugins to allow users to build their
		own customized version of jmpress.js.</p>
		<h3>Grunt</h3>
		<p>We use the command line build tool: 
		<a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt" target="_blank">grunt</a>. It
		requires nodejs. If you already have nodejs installed run the command
		<em>npm install -g grunt</em> to install grunt. Then navigate to your
		copy of jmpress.js and run the command: <em>grunt</em> to build. You can
		also use the command <em>grunt watch</em> to continuously build
		jmpress.js as you edit.</p>
		<p>The output files will be located in the <em>dist/</em> folder. Please
		do not edit any file in the <em>dist/</em> folder as they are
		automatically generated.</p>
